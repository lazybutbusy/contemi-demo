  p : NOVA Report is a Financial Information Reporting system that provides automatic generation of regulatory reports from data on the NOVA database as well as other sources. It retains imported data in a data repository, and populates the relevant reports using that data. These reports are generally scheduled to run automatically using an administrative tool, but can be run manually – for example to print a historic report. NOVA provides a standard report pack for each major market.
