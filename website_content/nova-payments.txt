     div : Real-time APIs to automate Payment \ Receipts transaction processing 
     p : The auto-payment process picks up open items in the client’s current account (related to settled contracts, journals, and corporate actions) and generates payments in the form of a cheque or direct credit. The system can be configured to generate separate jobs by currency, market, and client type. The system checks available funds across all payment methods to ensure the account is in a net credit state before making any payments.
