    div:
     h4 : Settlement Speed

     h4 : Operational Risks 
     p : The shift from conventional processes to those involving digital assets introduces new risks, including technology failures, regulatory challenges, and cybersecurity threats. Ensuring that systems can handle digital asset transactions seamlessly is critical. 
    span : Know More (https://nova.contemi.com/contact-us)

    h2 : Benefits 
    div:
     span : Lowering Entry Barriers 
     p : By digitizing assets the process becomes more streamlined and efficient by reducing paperwork, quicker verification processes, and the ability to divide large assets into smaller, more manageable digital tokens. 
    div:
     span : Operational Efficiency 
     p : DLT can streamline processes by providing a single source of truth that is accessible to all parties involved. This reduces the need for reconciliation between different records, which is both time-consuming and costly. 
    div:
     span : Global Participation
