        p : The end of 2023 will mark a pivotal moment in Malaysia’s stock market, with the government’s recent announcement to unveil fractional trading. The honourable Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim, announced on July 27th, 2023, that his government will allow trading of smaller share lots and fractional shares making investments affordable. “There will be more retail investors out there who can afford to buy shares…and I believe this will boost the Malaysian capital market,” said Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan at a press conference at the Bursa Marketplace Fair 2023 on August 5th. 
        p : This breakthrough development has the potential to revolutionize the market, making it more accessible and efficient for retail investors, thereby fostering increased liquidity, confidence, and economic progress. 
        h3 : UNDERSTANDING FRACTIONAL TRADING? 
        p : Fractional trading is a transformative approach that allows investors to buy or sell company shares in smaller denominations than the conventional board lot size. This initiative will make retail investors’ access to blue chip stocks easier. Now, even the shares of top-tier companies like AirAsia or Petronas become accessible without demanding a hefty investment.

        h3 : GOVERNMENT’S PARTICIPATION 
        p : Fractional trading represents an inspiring and optimistic change for Bursa Malaysia, laying the groundwork for an invigorated financial landscape. It’s a significant step, but there’s also an exciting opportunity for the government to take further action. By enhancing the profitability of listed companies and elevating the overall transparency and efficiency of the market, we can look forward to a thriving investment climate in Malaysia. Together with comprehensive strategies like support incentives, the country is poised to cultivate sustainable, long-term investment opportunities that benefit all. 
        h3 : CONCLUSION 
        p : Fractional trading marks a promising horizon for the Malaysian capital market, paving the way for more inclusive and affordable retail investing. But a holistic approach, focusing on overall market health, is vital. 
        p : A well-designed post-trade settlement solution like Nova+, already successful in Singapore market, can be the catalyst for smooth fractional trading. Contemi’s innovative solutions like Nova+ reiterate its unwavering commitment to nurturing capital markets.
