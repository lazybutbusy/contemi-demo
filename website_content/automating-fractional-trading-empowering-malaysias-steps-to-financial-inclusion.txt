        p : In September 2023, The Securities Commission of Malaysia (SC) announced the regulations that would allow stockbroking companies to offer fractional share trading services for shares listed on Bursa Malaysia. This remarkable initiative democratizes investment opportunities for a broader segment of society.

        p : Feature: Fractional trading is supported in separate instruments distinct from market trading, providing clarity and organization in the trading process. 
        p : Benefit: Clear separation ensures transparency and simplifies trade execution, reducing confusion and enhancing user experience. 
        strong : Flexible Cash Settlement options
